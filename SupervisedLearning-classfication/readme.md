# Naïve Bayes Classifier
Naïve Bayes is a classification technique used to build classifier using the Bayes theorem. The assumption is that the predictors are independent. In simple words, it assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For building Naïve Bayes classifier we need to use the python library called scikit learn. There are three types of Naïve Bayes models named Gaussian, Multinomial and Bernoulli under scikit learn package.


# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both     regression and classification.
* The main concept of SVM is to plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.
* Here n would be the features we would have. Following is a simple graphical representation to understand the concept of SVM −
