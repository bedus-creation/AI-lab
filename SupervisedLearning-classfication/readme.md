# Na誰ve Bayes Classifier
Na誰ve Bayes is a classification technique used to build classifier using the Bayes theorem. The assumption is that the predictors are independent. In simple words, it assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For building Na誰ve Bayes classifier we need to use the python library called scikit learn. There are three types of Na誰ve Bayes models named Gaussian, Multinomial and Bernoulli under scikit learn package.
