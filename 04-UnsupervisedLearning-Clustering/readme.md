# Unsupervised Learning: Clustering
* Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not have any supervisor to provide any sort of guidance.
* In unsupervised learning, there would be no correct answer and no teacher for the guidance. Algorithms need to discover the interesting pattern in data for learning.
# Clustering:
* Clustering mainly is a task of dividing the set of observations into subsets, called clusters on the basis of similarities and dissimilarities.
