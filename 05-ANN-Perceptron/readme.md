### ANN -Artificial Neural Network

Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) are programs designed to solve
any problem by trying to mimic the structure and the function of our
nervous system.

# Implemented
* Single layer perceptron
Single layer perceptron is implemented here with the example of logical and gate.
A single layer perceptron (SLP) is a feed-forward network based on a threshold transfer function. SLP is the simplest type of artificial neural networks and can only classify linearly separable cases with a binary target (1 , 0).
